## My Introduction to the World of Technology
My fascination with technology and coding began to take root from a young age. I loved playing video games and being a user of technology from a young age, but it was in middle school that I was really introduced to the world of technology, thanks to one inspiring science teacher. One year, he decided to deviate from the traditional curriculum. Instead of studying that yearâ€™s topic, geology, we found ourselves immersed in the world of technology and coding using platforms like Scratch to learn basic intuition for coding, exploring app development with Xcode, and later tinkering with Raspberry Pi devices. This unconventional introduction to technology proved pivotal, sparking my interest in the field.

After a few years, I decided to enroll in AP Computer Science in my senior year of high school. This was my true, depthful introduction to coding. Through this course, along with some self-reflection and future planning, I realized that my passions and life goals aligned quite well with a career in technology. It became abundantly clear that the different fields of tech held endless possibilities, and I was eager to explore them all. And so, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering.

## My College Experience
In college, I took a diverse array of courses, ranging from the standard foundational coding courses to slightly more advanced, specialized subjects. These included: Linear algebra and machine learning, web design, data structures and algorithms, software reverse engineering, telephone networks, digital hardware design, and operating systems. These courses expanded my horizons and equipped me with a well-rounded understanding of the many facets of software engineering.

My college experience also brought me under the guidance of an engineering professor with a distinguished career in cyber security and software engineering. His emphasis on curiosity and understanding became a cornerstone of my approach to the field. From unraveling the complexities of circuit-switched telephone networks to exploring the intricacies of hardware memory to learning the step-by-step process of how we get to set our eyeballs on a nice and safe webpage, my mentor instilled in me a true appreciation for the inner workings of technology. Although I know that I am just at the beginning of my knowledge gathering, I feel well-prepared and excited to tackle the dynamic and ever-evolving field of software engineering with enthusiasm and dedication.
