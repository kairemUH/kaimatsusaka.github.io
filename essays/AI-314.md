## Using AI assistance when coding

### Introduction

Despite AI's ability to transform the way we think and work, the topic of AI within education is a touchy one. Some feel it is equivalent to cheating, whereas others feel that learning how to properly use AI will be a necessary skill to have. Within the context of software engineering, it is very useful. There are many great tools such as chatGPT or more specified tools like GitHub Copilot that are very powerful.

### Use of AI in class

In my software engineering class, we were allowed to use AI in a majority of our coding assignments. We were encouraged to learn how to be good prompt engineers and discover how we like to incorporate AI into our workflow. 

For our workout-of-the-days, whether in person or at home assignments, I found that I rarely ever used AI. I found that GitHub Copilot was nice, but that its autocomplete was very often not accurate. It was in many cases more a hindrance than a help. As for external tools like chatGPT, I only used them on occasions where I was completely stumped on how to go about a problem. Along with forums like stack overflow, code documentation, and general googling, AI was a tool that I would use to help get myself unstuck. For this purpose, I found that it was sometimes useful. Usually, AI was just a nice supplementation to the other research methods, but in a few cases, it was all that was necessary to find a solution.

One of my favorite uses for AI is in the writing of essays. Engineers are notoriously subpar when it comes to writing prose, but luckily for us there are tools out there to help, and I belive large language AI tools like chatGPT to be one of those. Using AI to completely write essays is almost never a viable option. It leads to material that is often not coherent or does not follow your own thoughts. Instead, I prefer to use it to rewrite sentences or sections that I have already written but feel do not sound the best. Along with tools like Grammarly, which also incorporate AI, chatGPT is a great tool for improving prose in an essay.
