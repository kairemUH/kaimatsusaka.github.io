*Languages, languages, languages.*

Learning a new language comes with a myriad of expected and unexpected discoveries. Coming from my comfort zone of “lower” languages like C and C++, Javascript was a shock to the senses. Sometimes, the reputation of a specific language can heavily influence our perception of said language and what it is like to use. Sometimes these expectations are quite accurate, while other times they can be very misleading. In this case, I had heard a lot about Javascript and how powerful it is, but for me at first glance, it felt anything but. Interpreted languages always tend to rub me the wrong way on first use, and the nature of Javascript being a weakly typed language compounded this feeling. The unique features of the language, like how const values are not immutable and can be changed, but not re-referenced, or how type coercion is baked straight in, or the extremely confusing number of ways to mess with objects, and how objects are handled in other aspects of the language, it all felt screwy at first. It felt like it was hiding what was really going on, and as if it was made for a beginner. But as I began to get a better grasp at why these features are there and look at the language through the lens of what its intended purpose is (a powerful and versatile scripting language for complex webpage functionality) I started to appreciate its brilliance. Being able to do tasks simply, with so many different libraries and frameworks, all without being bogged down by the fussiness of a compiled language, is what makes it so great. I felt that anything I could think of doing, I could find something in the language to do it quickly and efficiently. I never felt like I was fighting the language, and compared to other interpreted languages, like Python ( indentation based syntax >:( ), I never felt like I was losing control over my code or making careless mistakes because of how the language separates the coder from the machine. Overall my learning experience with Javascript has been a positive one, and it has quickly become one of my favorite languages to use.
