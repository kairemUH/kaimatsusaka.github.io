## Smart vs Dumb Question

Asking questions is undoubtedly a large part of being a software engineer. In the field of tech, there is so much information and so many different tools out there that no one person can remember or learn it all. Asking a smart question is a great way to get that knowledge into your brain. But thats the key. Asking **smart** questions. One common  difference in whether a question is dumb or smart comes from the question of where it is coming from. Is it coming from a place of ignorance? Or is it coming from a place of laziness? If one is asking a question because they feel like just using someone else is an easier way of finding an answer than trying to find it themselves, then that is lazy. If they have been struggling with a problem and can't find a satisfactory conclusion or would perhaps like additional input and perspective, then it is a smart question.
