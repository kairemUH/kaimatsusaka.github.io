<h2 id="the-course">The Course</h2>

<p>ICS 414 was a university-guided course in which a team of student software engineers worked with a real customer to design meaningful software. This semester, we created version 1 of a non-profit community volunteering website called Voluntree.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-a-customer">Working With A Customer</h2>

<p>Working with non-technical business customers in software engineering is arguably one of the most important skills for a successful engineer to develop, and it requires clear communication and empathy. As a software engineer, it’s essential to translate complex technical jargon into accessible language that resonates with the customer’s needs and goals. Working with Sara and communicating back and forth to get a good idea of exactly what she was looking for was an excellent experience for me. I could voice development questions and concerns in a way that was easy for her to understand on a deep level. The question of backend development philosophy was a topic that reared itself a handful of times and was very enjoyable to tackle.</p>

<h2 id="continued-skill-building">Continued Skill Building</h2>

<p>Coding is fundamentally about continued skill building, and taking ICS 414 was a pivotal extension of my previous software engineering coursework. In this class, I had the invaluable opportunity to apply everything I had learned in a practical, hands-on environment. The project was designed not just to test our theoretical knowledge, but to deepen our understanding and proficiency through real-world application. This course challenged me to integrate and refine my skills, pushing me to innovate and troubleshoot as I would in a professional setting. It reinforced the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in software development, as each new challenge brought opportunities for growth and improvement.</p>

<h2 id="back-end-engineering">Back End Engineering</h2>

<p>Through the ICS 414 class, I discovered a genuine interest in backend engineering. This specialization appealed to me due to its critical role in the functionality and performance of applications. Currently, I am expanding my skills further by working on various backend projects using different frameworks, which allows me to explore diverse environments and refine my technical abilities. As I delved into the complexities of server-side logic, databases, and API integration in my other projects, it was very interesting to compare those frameworks to Meteor.JS, which was used for Voluntree. The benefits and drawbacks of using abstracted tools were interesting to discover. In both cases, I found immense satisfaction in constructing robust systems that operate seamlessly behind the scenes. This aspect of software development resonated with me because it requires a blend of analytical thinking and creative problem-solving. Each challenge in backend development offered a new learning curve and a chance to significantly impact the back end’s customer, the front end, and, as a result, the overall user experience.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-a-team">Working With a Team</h2>

<p>Just as with previous courses, working in a team setting on software projects is incredibly fulfilling. Getting the opportunity to see how your peers think is necessary for broadening your mindset and stopping stagnant thinking. Any opportunity to improve collaboration skills between engineers is one that should be taken.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This course has been incredibly satisfying to undertake. I loved working on Voluntree, and this class has been a good opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge in a real-world context, enhancing both my understanding and my technical skills. The hands-on project allowed me to dive deep into backend development and showed me the tangible impact of my work. It was a perfect blend of challenge and learning, and it has solidified my passion for backend engineering.</p>
