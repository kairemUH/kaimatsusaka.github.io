summary: "A console based application that scans all legal memory addresses on the system."
---

A wise man once said we live in a sea of illegal addresses. This program finds the islands of legal addresses scattered among that sea.  

This is a program that works on Linux systems. It functions by reading the maps file, a generated file that has a neatly organized list of current memory addresses.

My app parses this file and displays the system's memory in more depth. It can be used to visualize how virtual memory and physical memory are related and how operating systems make memory mapping efficient.
