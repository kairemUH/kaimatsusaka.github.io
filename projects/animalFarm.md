In my object-oriented programming (OOP) coding class, I created a program that demonstrates the functionality of OOP. This project displays a farm consisting of many different types of animals, all objects that inherit a starting node and are related to each other through object relationships.  

This project also has a custom weight class with multiple units and internal conversion functions.

The source code is hosted publicly on github [here](https://github.com/kairemUH/ee205-Animal-Farm).  

Documentation for Animal Farm is also is posted [here](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~kairem/ee205/animalFarm/index.html) using doxygen.
