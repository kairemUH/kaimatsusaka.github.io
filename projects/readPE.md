---

This project is a clone of readPE, a free program that reads and displays information about PE files (windows executables).

This project required many hours of research into the nature of windows executables and how that file format stores data.

Documentation on the PE file format can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format) and [here](https://0xrick.github.io/win-internals/pe1/), which were necessary to recreate the functionality of readPE.

The source code for my clone is published on github [here](https://github.com/SRE-Nelson/are_lab6_readpe-kairemUH).
